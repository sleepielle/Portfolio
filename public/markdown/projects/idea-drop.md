*A full-stack ideas platform with secure authentication and modern React architecture*
<br/>

IdeaDrop is a full-stack application that allows users to register, authenticate, and manage ideas through a clean, responsive UI and a secure Node.js/Express API. The project implements **JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens**, protected routes, and full CRUD functionality.

<br/>

This section documents **both the frontend UI and the backend API**, including setup, authentication flow, and available routes.

## ✨ Features

### UI Features
- User registration and login
- JWT-based authentication with automatic token refresh
- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) ideas
- Protected routes for creating and editing ideas
- Responsive and clean UI

### API Features

- Secure authentication with access and refresh tokens
- Full CRUD API for ideas
- Route-level authorization (owner-only updates & deletes)
- HTTP-only cookies for refresh tokens
- MongoDB-backed persistence

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React** (via Vite)
- **TanStack Router** – routing & protected routes
- **TanStack Query** – server-state management
- **Axios** – API communication
- Context API – authentication state

### Backend

- **Node.js**
- **Express**
- **MongoDB** (via Mongoose)
- **JWT** for authentication
- **Cookie-based refresh tokens**

## 📦 Frontend Setup (UI)

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

<br/>

---

<br/>


### 🔐 Environment Variables (Frontend)

Rename `example.env` to `.env` and configure:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

> Update the URL if your backend runs on a different host or port.

## 🔄 Frontend Authentication Flow
User logs in or registers.

API returns:
   - `accessToken` (short-lived)
   - `refreshToken` stored in a **secure, HTTP-only cookie**
  
`accessToken` is:
   - Stored in React context
   - Sent in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token

When:
   - The access token expires **or**
   - A hard refresh occurs

   The app automatically requests a new access token using the refresh token.

## 📦 Backend Setup (API)

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables (Backend)

Rename `example.env` to `.env` and configure:

```env
MONGO_URI="YOUR MONGODB ATLAS URL"
JWT_SECRET="ADD A SECRET"
```

<br/>




### Run Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🔐 How Backend Authentication Works

1. User hits `/register` or `/login`
2. Server responds with:
   - User data
   - **Short-lived access token** (default: 1 minute)
3. A **long-lived refresh token** (30 days) is stored in an **HTTP-only cookie**
4. Access token is used to:
   - Call protected routes (e.g. `POST /api/ideas`)
5. When the access token expires:
   - Client -calls `/api/auth/refresh`
   - Server validates refresh token from cookie
   - Issues a new access token

> Security-first, scalable, and production-ready.

## 🛣 API Routes

### 🔐 Auth Routes (`/api/auth`)

| Method | Endpoint    | Description                              | Auth Required  |
| -----: | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------- |
|   POST | `/register` | Register a new user                      | ❌ No           |
|   POST | `/login`    | Log in an existing user                  | ❌ No           |
|   POST | `/logout`   | Log out and clear refresh token          | ✅ Yes (cookie) |
|   POST | `/refresh`  | Get new access token using refresh token | ✅ Yes (cookie) |

**Notes:**

- Refresh tokens are stored in **HTTP-only cookies**
- Access tokens must be sent as:

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>
  ```

### 💡 Idea Routes (`/api/ideas`)

| Method | Endpoint | Description                 | Auth Required |
| -----: | -------- | --------------------------- | ------------- |
|GET | `/`      | Get all public ideas        | ❌ No          |
|GET | `/:id`   | Get a single idea by ID     | ❌ No          |
|POST | `/`      | Create a new idea           | ✅ Yes         |
|PUT | `/:id`   | Update an idea (owner only) | ✅ Yes         |
|DELETE | `/:id`   | Delete an idea (owner only) | ✅ Yes         |
